          <p id="RYLAinfo1">RYLA stands for Rotary Youth Leadership Awards which offers young people a chance to develop their leadership skills. I took part in this, learning about team working, positive leadership, communication, problem solving and decision making.</p>
          <p id="RYLAinfo2">When it came to the activity where I had to be the leader of my group, we had to navigate up through and back down the Cairngorm Mountains using a map, compass and the trail signs.</p>
          <p id="RYLAinfo3">This cemented and developed my skills on leading a team by listening to their ideas and use those ideas to help us navigate through the mountains rather than boss them about with instructions.  </p>

          <p id="DUSAinfo1">DUSA stands for Dundee University Students Association where I worked part time as venue support was a huge performance demanding with plenty of responsibilities job, such as reception, floor sweeping, cloakroom and a few more. This was matched by the speed of job to meet the satisfaction of almost all of the students at the University of Dundee and other university students from across Scotland.</p>
          <p id="DUSAinfo2">This job help strengthened my skills of multitasking such as taking in multiple and handing out the correct ticket to the right customer. My attention to detail was a serious skill needed to check every ID and Student ID to correctly sure that they could enter and pay for the right ticket. Time management was also an essential skill to have to meet all the customersâ€™ satisfaction as well as the company expectations as well.</p>
