This my website CV

<h2>Repository Information</h2>
The work I got done per day:

* Day 1 - Set up and links to each website
* Day 2 - Set up the css for all pages and added content
* Day 3 - All html and css are done, just need to do responsive design and w3c validation
* Day 4 - All responsive is done with all comments added. The website has been check with w3c validation as well
* Day 4 - Renamed cvHomePage to index, hoping that'll get GitHub Pages to work
